// Arrays work best for Complete binary trees (binary trees where all nodes at a height less than height(tree) are full (all nodes are degree(2)) and the nodes at height(tree) are added
// leftmost to right most
// 
// ie this would mean that an array is best suited for a binary tree when the binary tree will NOT put any holes in the array storing the nodes
