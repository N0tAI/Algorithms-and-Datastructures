# Datastructures and Algorithms
This github repository serves as a repository of any specific datastructures and/or algorithms I encounter that I think are worth maintaining and improving upon in my own time.
Feel free to browse but do note I will not guarantee that any implementation is completed, compilable, or efficient; Though I do strive to do achieve this.
